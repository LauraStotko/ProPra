Solution for Task 4: Mysterious Virus


1. Introduction
Description of the case: A traveler with flu-like symptoms and an identified DNA sequence.
Data source: misteriosa_virus.fasta.


2. BLAST Search

a. Introducing BLAST
- Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.
- Definition: BLAST finds regions of similarity between biological sequences.
- Function: The program compares nucleotide / protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance.

b. Number of Searched Sequences
- Selected sequences: 100 
- Number of sequences: 103549012

c. Meaning of E-values
- The E-value represents the likelihood of obtaining a similar or better sequence alignment by chance.
    A lower E-value indicates higher significance, with smaller values suggesting a more biologically meaningful similarity.
- All observed E-values were 0.0.


3. Identification of the Viral Gene
- Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
